Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)

Purpose:
The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) became law in 2005. Its goal is to make Ontario fully accessible by 2025 by developing, implementing, and enforcing accessibility standards.

Who It Applies To:
The AODA applies to:
- All organizations in Ontario (public, private, and not-for-profit) that have 1 or more employees
- Different requirements based on organization size:
  - Organizations with 50+ employees: Must meet all requirements and file compliance reports
  - Organizations with 1-49 employees: Must meet most requirements but are exempt from some documentation and reporting

The AODA does NOT apply to:
- Organizations outside Ontario (unless they do business in Ontario)
- Federally regulated entities (they follow the Accessible Canada Act)
- Self-employed individuals with no employees

Organization Size Thresholds:

- 50+ employees: Full compliance including:
  - Accessibility policies
  - Multi-year accessibility plans
  - Compliance reports every 2-3 years

Five Accessibility Standards:
1. Customer Service Standard (2008)
2. Information and Communications Standard
3. Employment Standard
4. Transportation Standard
5. Design of Public Spaces Standard

Standards 2-5 are part of the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation (IASR).
